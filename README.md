# challengeProjects
coding challenges from my learning academy c++ course.

These are my solutions to section challenges in my Learning Academy C++ course.
Some instances have both my solution and the instructors.
Others have just incorporated the correct code into my own.  
In other words, I created a unique solution that works but may be less efficient.
Therefore, I incorporated the instructor's ideas in places where my code was inefficient.
